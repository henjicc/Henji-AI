# Wan 2.5 Text to Image

> Wan 2.5 text-to-image model.


## Overview

- **Endpoint**: `https://fal.run/fal-ai/wan-25-preview/text-to-image`
- **Model ID**: `fal-ai/wan-25-preview/text-to-image`
- **Category**: text-to-image
- **Kind**: inference


## API Information

This model can be used via our HTTP API or more conveniently via our client libraries.
See the input and output schema below, as well as the usage examples.


### Input Schema

The API accepts the following input parameters:


- **`prompt`** (`string`, _required_):
  The prompt for image generation. Supports Chinese and English, max 2000 characters.
  - Examples: "A lone samurai standing on the edge of a cliff at twilight, overlooking a vast valley shrouded in mist. The sky burns with deep orange and purple hues from the setting sun, casting long, dramatic shadows. The samurai’s silhouette glows against the horizon, with their sword reflecting a glint of fading light. The overall style is hyper-realistic, cinematic, and moody, with dramatic contrast and atmospheric depth."

- **`negative_prompt`** (`string`, _optional_):
  Negative prompt to describe content to avoid. Max 500 characters.
  - Examples: "low resolution, error, worst quality, low quality, defects"

- **`num_images`** (`integer`, _optional_):
  Number of images to generate. Values from 1 to 4. Default value: `1`
  - Default: `1`
  - Range: `1` to `4`
  - Examples: 1

- **`image_size`** (`ImageSize | Enum`, _optional_):
  The size of the generated image. Can use preset names like 'square', 'landscape_16_9', etc., or specific dimensions. Total pixels must be between 768×768 and 1440×1440, with aspect ratio between [1:4, 4:1]. Default value: `square`
  - Default: `"square"`
  - One of: ImageSize | Enum
  - Examples: "square", "landscape_16_9", "portrait_16_9", {"height":1280,"width":1280}

- **`enable_prompt_expansion`** (`boolean`, _optional_):
  Whether to enable prompt rewriting using LLM. Improves results for short prompts but increases processing time. Default value: `true`
  - Default: `true`

- **`seed`** (`integer`, _optional_):
  Random seed for reproducibility. If None, a random seed is chosen.

- **`enable_safety_checker`** (`boolean`, _optional_):
  If set to true, the safety checker will be enabled. Default value: `true`
  - Default: `true`
  - Examples: true

## Usage Examples

### cURL

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://fal.run/fal-ai/wan-25-preview/text-to-image \
  --header "Authorization: Key $FAL_KEY" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
     "prompt": "A lone samurai standing on the edge of a cliff at twilight, overlooking a vast valley shrouded in mist.

The overall style is hyper-realistic, cinematic, and moody, with dramatic contrast and atmospheric depth."
   }'
```

### Python

Ensure you have the Python client installed:

```bash
pip install fal-client
```

Then use the API client to make requests:

```python
import fal_client

def on_queue_update(update):
    if isinstance(update, fal_client.InProgress):
        for log in update.logs:
           print(log["message"])

result = fal_client.subscribe(
    "fal-ai/wan-25-preview/text-to-image",
    arguments={
        "prompt": "A lone samurai standing on the edge of a cliff at twilight, overlooking a vast valley shrouded in mist. The sky burns with deep orange and purple hues from the setting sun, casting long, dramatic shadows. The samurai’s silhouette glows against the horizon, with their sword reflecting a glint of fading light. The overall style is hyper-realistic, cinematic, and moody, with dramatic contrast and atmospheric depth."
    },
    with_logs=True,
    on_queue_update=on_queue_update,
)
print(result)
```

### JavaScript

Ensure you have the JavaScript client installed:

```bash
npm install --save @fal-ai/client
```

Then use the API client to make requests:

```javascript
import { fal } from "@fal-ai/client";

const result = await fal.subscribe("fal-ai/wan-25-preview/text-to-image", {
  input: {
    prompt: "A lone samurai standing on the edge of a cliff at twilight, overlooking a vast valley shrouded in mist. The sky burns with deep orange and purple hues from the setting sun, casting long, dramatic shadows. The samurai’s silhouette glows against the horizon, with their sword reflecting a glint of fading light. The overall style is hyper-realistic, cinematic, and moody, with dramatic contrast and atmospheric depth."
  },
  logs: true,
  onQueueUpdate: (update) => {
    if (update.status === "IN_PROGRESS") {
      update.logs.map((log) => log.message).forEach(console.log);
    }
  },
});
console.log(result.data);
console.log(result.requestId);
```

# MiniMax Hailuo 2.3 [Pro] (Text to Video)

> MiniMax Hailuo-2.3 Text To Video API (Pro, 1080p): Advanced text-to-video generation model with 1080p resolution


## Overview

- **Endpoint**: `https://fal.run/fal-ai/minimax/hailuo-2.3/pro/text-to-video`
- **Model ID**: `fal-ai/minimax/hailuo-2.3/pro/text-to-video`
- **Category**: text-to-video
- **Kind**: inference
**Tags**: text-to-video



## API Information

This model can be used via our HTTP API or more conveniently via our client libraries.
See the input and output schema below, as well as the usage examples.


### Input Schema

The API accepts the following input parameters:


- **`prompt`** (`string`, _required_):
  Text prompt for video generation
  - Examples: "The camera follows the snowboarder as they carve down the mountain through deep powder, each turn sending up huge rooster tails of snow. They navigate between trees, floating through the powder with smooth, flowing movements. The rider launches off a natural jump, grabbing the board mid-air before landing softly in deep snow and continuing down. Powder sprays continuously as they link turns together. The atmosphere is exhilarating and free. Audio: Board cutting through snow, powder spraying, wind rushing, the rider's excited shouts, and the soft thuds of landing in deep snow."

- **`prompt_optimizer`** (`boolean`, _optional_):
  Whether to use the model's prompt optimizer Default value: `true`
  - Default: `true`



**Required Parameters Example**:

```json
{
  "prompt": "The camera follows the snowboarder as they carve down the mountain through deep powder, each turn sending up huge rooster tails of snow. They navigate between trees, floating through the powder with smooth, flowing movements. The rider launches off a natural jump, grabbing the board mid-air before landing softly in deep snow and continuing down. Powder sprays continuously as they link turns together. The atmosphere is exhilarating and free. Audio: Board cutting through snow, powder spraying, wind rushing, the rider's excited shouts, and the soft thuds of landing in deep snow."
}
```

**Full Example**:

```json
{
  "prompt": "The camera follows the snowboarder as they carve down the mountain through deep powder, each turn sending up huge rooster tails of snow. They navigate between trees, floating through the powder with smooth, flowing movements. The rider launches off a natural jump, grabbing the board mid-air before landing softly in deep snow and continuing down. Powder sprays continuously as they link turns together. The atmosphere is exhilarating and free. Audio: Board cutting through snow, powder spraying, wind rushing, the rider's excited shouts, and the soft thuds of landing in deep snow.",
  "prompt_optimizer": true
}
```


### Output Schema

The API returns the following output format:

- **`video`** (`File`, _required_):
  The generated video
  - Examples: {"url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/falserverless/example_outputs/hailuo23/pro_t2v_out.mp4"}



**Example Response**:

```json
{
  "video": {
    "url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/falserverless/example_outputs/hailuo23/pro_t2v_out.mp4"
  }
}
```


## Usage Examples

### cURL

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://fal.run/fal-ai/minimax/hailuo-2.3/pro/text-to-video \
  --header "Authorization: Key $FAL_KEY" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
     "prompt": "The camera follows the snowboarder as they carve down the mountain through deep powder, each turn sending up huge rooster tails of snow. They navigate between trees, floating through the powder with smooth, flowing movements. The rider launches off a natural jump, grabbing the board mid-air before landing softly in deep snow and continuing down. Powder sprays continuously as they link turns together. The atmosphere is exhilarating and free. Audio: Board cutting through snow, powder spraying, wind rushing, the rider's excited shouts, and the soft thuds of landing in deep snow."
   }'
```

### Python

Ensure you have the Python client installed:

```bash
pip install fal-client
```

Then use the API client to make requests:

```python
import fal_client

def on_queue_update(update):
    if isinstance(update, fal_client.InProgress):
        for log in update.logs:
           print(log["message"])

result = fal_client.subscribe(
    "fal-ai/minimax/hailuo-2.3/pro/text-to-video",
    arguments={
        "prompt": "The camera follows the snowboarder as they carve down the mountain through deep powder, each turn sending up huge rooster tails of snow. They navigate between trees, floating through the powder with smooth, flowing movements. The rider launches off a natural jump, grabbing the board mid-air before landing softly in deep snow and continuing down. Powder sprays continuously as they link turns together. The atmosphere is exhilarating and free. Audio: Board cutting through snow, powder spraying, wind rushing, the rider's excited shouts, and the soft thuds of landing in deep snow."
    },
    with_logs=True,
    on_queue_update=on_queue_update,
)
print(result)
```

### JavaScript

Ensure you have the JavaScript client installed:

```bash
npm install --save @fal-ai/client
```

Then use the API client to make requests:

```javascript
import { fal } from "@fal-ai/client";

const result = await fal.subscribe("fal-ai/minimax/hailuo-2.3/pro/text-to-video", {
  input: {
    prompt: "The camera follows the snowboarder as they carve down the mountain through deep powder, each turn sending up huge rooster tails of snow. They navigate between trees, floating through the powder with smooth, flowing movements. The rider launches off a natural jump, grabbing the board mid-air before landing softly in deep snow and continuing down. Powder sprays continuously as they link turns together. The atmosphere is exhilarating and free. Audio: Board cutting through snow, powder spraying, wind rushing, the rider's excited shouts, and the soft thuds of landing in deep snow."
  },
  logs: true,
  onQueueUpdate: (update) => {
    if (update.status === "IN_PROGRESS") {
      update.logs.map((log) => log.message).forEach(console.log);
    }
  },
});
console.log(result.data);
console.log(result.requestId);
```

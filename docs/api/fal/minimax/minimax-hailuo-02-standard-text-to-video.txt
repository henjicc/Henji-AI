Their belt is adorned with energy-based weapons, ready to be drawn at any moment to protect themselves or escape from tight situations. This character thrives in the shadows of space, navigating between the law and chaos with stealth and wit, always seeking the next big score while evading bounty hunters and law enforcement.

### Python

Ensure you have the Python client installed:

```bash
pip install fal-client
```

Then use the API client to make requests:

```python
import fal_client

def on_queue_update(update):
    if isinstance(update, fal_client.InProgress):
        for log in update.logs:
           print(log["message"])

result = fal_client.subscribe(
    "fal-ai/minimax/hailuo-02/standard/text-to-video",
    arguments={
        "prompt": "A Galactic Smuggler is a rogue figure with a cybernetic arm and a well-worn coat that hints at many dangerous escapades across the galaxy. Their ship is filled with rare and exotic treasures from distant planets, concealed in hidden compartments, showing their expertise in illicit trade.

    },
    with_logs=True,
    on_queue_update=on_queue_update,
)
print(result)
```

### JavaScript

Ensure you have the JavaScript client installed:

```bash
npm install --save @fal-ai/client
```

Then use the API client to make requests:

```javascript
import { fal } from "@fal-ai/client";

const result = await fal.subscribe("fal-ai/minimax/hailuo-02/standard/text-to-video", {
  input: {
    prompt: "A Galactic Smuggler is a rogue figure with a cybernetic arm and a well-worn coat that hints at many dangerous escapades across the galaxy.

  },
  logs: true,
  onQueueUpdate: (update) => {
    if (update.status === "IN_PROGRESS") {
      update.logs.map((log) => log.message).forEach(console.log);
    }
  },
});
console.log(result.data);
console.log(result.requestId);

  - Examples: "A hyper-realistic, close-up portrait of a tribal elder from the Omo Valley, painted with intricate white chalk patterns and adorned with a headdress made of dried flowers, seed pods, and rusted bottle caps. The focus is razor-sharp on the texture of the skin, showing every pore, wrinkle, and scar that tells a story of survival. The background is a blurred, smoky hut interior, with the warm glow of a cooking fire reflecting in the subject's dark, soulful eyes. Shot on a Leica M6 with Kodak Portra 400 film grain aesthetic."

## Usage Examples

### cURL

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://fal.run/fal-ai/z-image/turbo \
  --header "Authorization: Key $FAL_KEY" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
     "prompt": "A hyper-realistic, close-up portrait of a tribal elder from the Omo Valley, painted with intricate white chalk patterns and adorned with a headdress made of dried flowers, seed pods, and rusted bottle caps.

   }'
```

### Python

Ensure you have the Python client installed:

```bash
pip install fal-client
```

Then use the API client to make requests:

```python
import fal_client

def on_queue_update(update):
    if isinstance(update, fal_client.InProgress):
        for log in update.logs:
           print(log["message"])

result = fal_client.subscribe(
    "fal-ai/z-image/turbo",
    arguments={
        "prompt": "A hyper-realistic, close-up portrait of a tribal elder from the Omo Valley, painted with intricate white chalk patterns and adorned with a headdress made of dried flowers, seed pods, and rusted bottle caps. The focus is razor-sharp on the texture of the skin, showing every pore, wrinkle, and scar that tells a story of survival. The background is a blurred, smoky hut interior, with the warm glow of a cooking fire reflecting in the subject's dark, soulful eyes. Shot on a Leica M6 with Kodak Portra 400 film grain aesthetic."
    },
    with_logs=True,
    on_queue_update=on_queue_update,
)
print(result)
```

### JavaScript

Ensure you have the JavaScript client installed:

```bash
npm install --save @fal-ai/client
```

Then use the API client to make requests:

```javascript
import { fal } from "@fal-ai/client";

const result = await fal.subscribe("fal-ai/z-image/turbo", {
  input: {
    prompt: "A hyper-realistic, close-up portrait of a tribal elder from the Omo Valley, painted with intricate white chalk patterns and adorned with a headdress made of dried flowers, seed pods, and rusted bottle caps. The focus is razor-sharp on the texture of the skin, showing every pore, wrinkle, and scar that tells a story of survival. The background is a blurred, smoky hut interior, with the warm glow of a cooking fire reflecting in the subject's dark, soulful eyes. Shot on a Leica M6 with Kodak Portra 400 film grain aesthetic."
  },
  logs: true,
  onQueueUpdate: (update) => {
    if (update.status === "IN_PROGRESS") {
      update.logs.map((log) => log.message).forEach(console.log);
    }
  },
});
console.log(result.data);
console.log(result.requestId);
```

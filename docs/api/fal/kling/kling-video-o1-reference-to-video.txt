## Overview

- **Endpoint**: `https://fal.run/fal-ai/kling-video/o1/reference-to-video`
- **Model ID**: `fal-ai/kling-video/o1/reference-to-video`
- **Category**: image-to-video
- **Kind**: inference


## API Information

This model can be used via our HTTP API or more conveniently via our client libraries.
See the input and output schema below, as well as the usage examples.


### Input Schema

The API accepts the following input parameters:


- **`prompt`** (`string`, _required_):
  Take @Element1, @Element2 to reference elements and @Image1, @Image2 to reference images in order.
  - Examples: "Take @Image1 as the start frame. Start with a high-angle satellite view of the ancient greenhouse ruin surrounded by nature. The camera swoops down and flies inside the building, revealing the character from @Element1 standing in the sun-drenched center. The camera then seamlessly transitions into a smooth 180-degree orbit around the character, moving to the back view. As the open backpack comes into focus, the camera continues to push forward, zooming deep inside the bag to reveal the glowing stone from @Element2 nestled inside. Cinematic lighting, hopeful atmosphere, 35mm lens. Make sure to keep it as the style of @Image2."

- **`image_urls`** (`list<string>`, _optional_):
  Additional reference images for style/appearance. Reference in prompt as @Image1, @Image2, etc. Maximum 7 total (elements + reference images + start image).
  - Array of string
  - Examples: ["https://v3b.fal.media/files/b/koala/v9COzzH23FGBYdGLgbK3u.png","https://v3b.fal.media/files/b/elephant/5Is2huKQFSE7A7c5uUeUF.png"]

- **`elements`** (`list<OmniVideoElementInput>`, _optional_):
  Elements (characters/objects) to include in the video. Reference in prompt as @Element1, @Element2, etc. Maximum 7 total (elements + reference images + start image).
  - Array of OmniVideoElementInput
  - Examples: [{"reference_image_urls":["https://v3b.fal.media/files/b/kangaroo/YMpmQkYt9xugpOTQyZW0O.png","https://v3b.fal.media/files/b/zebra/d6ywajNyJ6bnpa_xBue-K.png"],"frontal_image_url":"https://v3b.fal.media/files/b/panda/MQp-ghIqshvMZROKh9lW3.png"},{"reference_image_urls":["https://v3b.fal.media/files/b/kangaroo/EBF4nWihspyv4pp6hgj7D.png"],"frontal_image_url":"https://v3b.fal.media/files/b/koala/gSnsA7HJlgcaTyR5Ujj2H.png"}]

- **`duration`** (`DurationEnum`, _optional_):
  Video duration in seconds. Only 5 and 10 are supported. Default value: `"5"`
  - Default: `"5"`
  - Options: `"5"`, `"10"`

- **`aspect_ratio`** (`AspectRatioEnum`, _optional_):
  The aspect ratio of the generated video frame. Default value: `"16:9"`
  - Default: `"16:9"`
  - Options: `"16:9"`, `"9:16"`, `"1:1"`

## Usage Examples

### cURL

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://fal.run/fal-ai/kling-video/o1/reference-to-video \
  --header "Authorization: Key $FAL_KEY" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
     "prompt": "Take @Image1 as the start frame. Start with a high-angle satellite view of the ancient greenhouse ruin surrounded by nature. The camera swoops down and flies inside the building, revealing the character from @Element1 standing in the sun-drenched center.

   }'
```

### Python

Ensure you have the Python client installed:

```bash
pip install fal-client
```

Then use the API client to make requests:

```python
import fal_client

def on_queue_update(update):
    if isinstance(update, fal_client.InProgress):
        for log in update.logs:
           print(log["message"])

result = fal_client.subscribe(
    "fal-ai/kling-video/o1/reference-to-video",
    arguments={
        "prompt": "Take @Image1 as the start frame. Start with a high-angle satellite view of the ancient greenhouse ruin surrounded by nature. The camera swoops down and flies inside the building, revealing the character from @Element1 standing in the sun-drenched center. The camera then seamlessly transitions into a smooth 180-degree orbit around the character, moving to the back view. As the open backpack comes into focus, the camera continues to push forward, zooming deep inside the bag to reveal the glowing stone from @Element2 nestled inside. Cinematic lighting, hopeful atmosphere, 35mm lens. Make sure to keep it as the style of @Image2."
    },
    with_logs=True,
    on_queue_update=on_queue_update,
)
print(result)
```

### JavaScript

Ensure you have the JavaScript client installed:

```bash
npm install --save @fal-ai/client
```

Then use the API client to make requests:

```javascript
import { fal } from "@fal-ai/client";

const result = await fal.subscribe("fal-ai/kling-video/o1/reference-to-video", {
  input: {
    prompt: "Take @Image1 as the start frame. Start with a high-angle satellite view of the ancient greenhouse ruin surrounded by nature. The camera swoops down and flies inside the building, revealing the character from @Element1 standing in the sun-drenched center. The camera then seamlessly transitions into a smooth 180-degree orbit around the character, moving to the back view. As the open backpack comes into focus, the camera continues to push forward, zooming deep inside the bag to reveal the glowing stone from @Element2 nestled inside. Cinematic lighting, hopeful atmosphere, 35mm lens. Make sure to keep it as the style of @Image2."
  },
  logs: true,
  onQueueUpdate: (update) => {
    if (update.status === "IN_PROGRESS") {
      update.logs.map((log) => log.message).forEach(console.log);
    }
  },
});
console.log(result.data);
console.log(result.requestId);
